# collisions_ds_web_app

This is a Streamlit dashboard for analyzing motor vehicle collisions in New York City.

To build it, I essentially followed the steps in this [Coursera tutorial](https://www.coursera.org/projects/data-science-streamlit-python), with a few small modifications.

Required packages:
```
streamlit
numpy
pandas
plotly
```
